Handle mounts via 5/16"-18 threaded rod/bolt

Standard tripod mounts are 1/4"-20, 3/8"-16 and 5/8"-11 threads. Most Camera Tripods use the 1/4"-20, and most Survey Tripods use the 5/8"-11

I had to drill out the hole to 5/16" and then tap with 3/8"-16 (See Bosch BDT38F16) to use standard camera tripod and mount adapters. I used a knurled-nut style, but you can also use threaded inserts.
