These are some uCenter (Classic / 21.09) scripts to enable different volumes of diagnostic messages on Rover or Base units
depending on your logging capabilities / capacities. These represent minimum expectations by uBlox for any analysis of odd / abherent
behaviour.

Basically apply via Tools -> GNSS/Receiver Configuration -> File >> GNSS
https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/u-centersetup_v21.09.zip

You can also convert these to commands sent by your own embedded app as/where appropriate.
