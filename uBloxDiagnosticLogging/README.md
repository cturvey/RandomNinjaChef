These are some uCenter (Classic / 24.04) scripts to enable different volumes of diagnostic messages on Rover or Base units
depending on your logging capabilities / capacities. These represent minimum expectations by uBlox for any analysis of odd / abherent
behaviour.

Basically apply via Tools -> GNSS/Receiver Configuration -> File >> GNSS

You can also convert these to commands sent by your own embedded app as/where appropriate.

ucenter_debug.txt are those messages which uCenter Classic enables when requested

I need to make a script for SPARTN / Point Perfect debugging
