H745I-DISCO eMMC Demo

A custom builds I made while experimenting with DMA and DDR at 8-bit for a client, and benchmarking/validating eMMC support.

Serial debug via VCP at 115200 8N1

MSC DEVICE is experimental port from H747I-DISCO with MMC code merged from the demo 
Board powered/debugged via ST-LINK, with MSC USB via the USB-FS connector

Also got other eMMC code working on the H743ZI-NUCLEO (via Clam-Shell), H750-DK
